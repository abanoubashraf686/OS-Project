# Operating Systems Development Project

Welcome to the Operating Systems Development Project repository! This project represents a comprehensive journey through the key components of operating system development, meticulously structured into three distinct phases or milestones. Each phase was rigorously tested and validated by our dedicated team, ensuring a robust and fully functional outcome.

## Project Overview

This project was designed and supervised by Dr. Ahmed Salah, a renowned expert in the field of operating systems. The aim was to create a hands-on learning experience, providing insight into the intricate details of OS development. The project has been divided into three milestones, each focusing on a different aspect of operating system design and implementation.

### Milestones Overview

- **Milestone 1 (MS1):** A deep dive into dynamic memory allocation and system call handling.
- **Milestone 2 (MS2):** Focused on kernel and user heap management, addressing crucial elements like page fault handling.
- **Milestone 3 (MS3):** Covers advanced topics like process scheduling and sophisticated memory management techniques.

For detailed information on each milestone, please refer to the following documentation:
